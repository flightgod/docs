---

This guide is to assist in extracting your .XML files after initial installation has been completed.

## Linux

1. Close OpenPnP. (This is very important to do before moving to the next step.)

2. To extract these files, you'll need to find its configuration folder. In the Ubuntu file manager (Nautilus), press `CTRL` + `H` to show hidden files, or go to the `View` menu and check `Show Hidden Files`.

3. Next, navigate to: `/home/[username]/.openpnp2`.

4. Double check that OpenPnP is closed.

5. In the `.openpnp2` folder you'll find your currently used configuration files, `machine.xml`, `packages.xml`, `parts.xml`, and `vision-settings.xml`.You will want the `machine.xml` and `vision-settings.xml` files.

6. Copy the `machine.xml` and `vision-settings.xml` configuration files from `.openpnp2`.

7. After you have copied and pasted these files to your desired location, confirm all four of your configuration files are still in `.openpnp2`.
