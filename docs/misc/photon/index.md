# Photon Protocol

The Photon Protocol is designed to facilitate **two different types of addressing**. In Photon, you can address a feeder using both its UUID (the hard-coded name of that unique device) and its slot (the physical location on the machine). This is so that we can:

- keep track of what part is loaded into a feeder even when it's moved to a different location
- find a feeder regardless of where it's loaded on the machine
- easily discover new feeders when they're loaded onto the machine

Only the host may initiate communication. Every Photon interaction is comprised of two packets: one packet from the host with a command and optional payload, and a response from a feeder with a status and optional payload of information.

The following is the basic Photon packet structure.

The packet is made up of two parts: the header and the payload. The header contains exactly five bytes: "to" address, "from" address, packet ID, payload length, and the CRC. The payload *always* has at least one byte, either a command ID or a status. The payload can have optional further bytes.

The host can send either broadcast and unicast commands. Unicast commands are meant for only the device in a certain slot. Broadcast commands are effectively speaking to the whole bus, and are instead addressing based on UUID, initialization status, or potentially other factors.

**Example Feeder Init and Feed**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant H as Host
    participant F as Slot 5
    H->>F: Hey, is a feeder at slot 5? (Command ID: 0x01)
    activate F
    F->>H: Yes, my name is {UUID}
    deactivate F
    H->>F: Cool, please initalize. (Command ID: 0x02)
    activate F
    F->>H: I am initialized.
    deactivate F
    H->>F: Please feed 4mm. (Command ID: 0x04)
    activate F
    F->>H: On it!
    H->>F: Are you done yet? (Command ID: 0x06)
    Note right of H: Delay
    H->>F: Are you done yet? (Command ID: 0x06)
    Note right of H: Delay
    H->>F: Are you done yet? (Command ID: 0x06)
    F->>H: I'm done, and I fed successfully.
    deactivate F
```

**Example Bus Scan**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant H as Host
    participant F as Slot N
    loop
        H->>F: Hey, is a feeder at slot N? (Command ID: 0x01)
        F->>H: Yes, my name is {UUID}
        H->>F: Cool, please initalize (Command ID: 0x02)
        activate F
        F->>H: I am initialized.
        deactivate F
        Note right of H: N++
    end
```

## Header Bytes

### To Address

This byte indicates which address the packet is intended for. This address value is equivalent to the slot addresses.

Valid values are anywhere between `0x00` and `0xFF`. Address `0x00` is reserved for the host, and address `0xFF` is reserved for broadcast commands.

### From Address

This byte indicates which address the packet is coming from. This address value is equivalent to the slot addresses.

Valid values are anywhere between `0x00` and `0xFF`. Address `0x00` is reserved for the host, and `0xFF` should not be used.

### Packet ID

The Packet ID is an identifying byte that allows the devices on the bus to keep track of requests. When a feeder responds to a command, it includes the Packet ID of the initiating packet. This allows the host to determine which packet the feeder is responding to.

This byte is a value between `0x00` and `0xFF`. The host should increment this value for every command sent, and roll back to `0x00` once it reaches `0xFF`.

### Payload Length

The payload length is the number of bytes contained in the payload. This number will always be at least `0x01`, as each packet has at least a Command ID or Status.

### CRC

The CRC byte is a checksum calculated on the entire packet sans the checksum byte. The checksum can be calculated as shown below:

JavaScript

``` javascript
calcCRC(data){
    let crc = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i<data.length; i++){
        crc = crc ^ (data[i] << 8);
        for(let j = 0; j < 8; j++){
            if ((crc & 0x8000) != 0) {
            crc = crc ^ (0x1070 << 3);
            }
            crc <<= 1;
        }
    }
    return (crc >> 8) & 0xFF;
}
```

C

``` c
uint8_t crc8(uint8_t data, size_t len) {
    uint32_t crc = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        crc ^= (data << 8);
        for (size_t bit_n = 0; bit_n < 8; bit_n++) {
            if (crc & 0x8000) {
                crc ^= (0x1070 << 3);
            }
            crc <<= 1;
        }
    }

    return (uint8_t)(crc >> 8);
}
```

Once the CRC is calculated, it should be spliced into the packet in the appropriate location. The CRC should be recalculated and compared with the received CRC for every received packet to confirm data integrity.

## Payload

The first byte of the payload is always a Command ID when coming from the host, and always a Status when coming as a response from a feeder. The Command ID tells the feeder what action to perform or what information to send. The Status tells the host the status of the command.

The rest of the payload is used for any other information that needs to be sent, depending on the situation.

### MOVE_FEED_STATUS `0x06`

MOVE_FEED_STATUS is used to determine if a feeder has finished a feed command, and get the status of the last feed. Feeding is blocking, so this command is intended to be used to probe a feeder until a response is received with the last feed's status.

VENDOR_OPTIONS is a section used to add vendor-specific commands behind a dedicated command ID. The specifics of this command depend on your implementation.

#### Example

Send:

## Broadcast Commands

### GET_FEEDER_ADDRESS `0xC0`

| Send                 |              |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Requires Initialized | NO           |
| Addressing           | BROADCAST      |
| Payload              | 12 Byte UUID |

| Receive              | Value              | Position |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Status               | `OK`         | 0       |
| Payload              | None |    |

GET_FEEDER_ADDRESS is used to get the slot address of a feeder based on its UUID. If a feeder's UUID matches the one sent in the payload, it will respond with status `OK` (0x00) with a "From" address that indicates its slot.

#### Example

Send:

```
[FF] [00] [07] [0D] [C0] [C0] [02] [48] ..... [37] [30]
 |    |    |    |    |    |    |_____________________|

IDENTIFY_FEEDER is used to cause the feeder to do some action that makes it identifiable by a user. For example, the LumenPnP feeders flash their main indicator light when they receive this command.

#### Example

| Payload              | 12 Byte UUID       | 1-12    |

UNINITIALIZED_FEEDERS_RESPOND causes all feeders on the bus that are not initialized to respond. This command should only be used when it's known that there's only one uninitialized feeder on the bus. This command is mainly used for helping in slot programming utilies.

Send:

```
[FF] [00] [07] [0E] [C0] [C3]
